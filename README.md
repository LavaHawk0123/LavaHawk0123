## Welcome 👋
I'm Aditya Arun Iyer, A Computer  Science  sophomore at  MIT Manipal. I have  an  avid interestin robotics  and  automation  with a primary focus on perception,  planning  and simulations. I am currently expanding my knowledge on developing and coding automation systems  for industrial  and  scientific  tasks  carried  out  by  complex robotic systems. I am proficient in <b><a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170">C++</a></b>,  <b><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System(ROS)</a></b> with over a year of experience in each of them. Focused and self-motivating, I look to make myself better every day and help my team do the same.
 
I'm currently working as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer in the Artificial Intelligence and Automation Subsystem at <a href = "http://www.marsrovermanipal.com/">Mars Rover Manipal</a> , a multi-disciplinary student project that develops Mars Rovers from scratch and competes alongside top universities such as Stanford and Michigan in Rover Challenges across the globe.

My work revolved aroundcreating the Navigation Stack for the rover and all the associated codes, prototypes and simulations. I worked on creating and implementing state estimation and a custom planning algorithm for a 6-wheeled rover
